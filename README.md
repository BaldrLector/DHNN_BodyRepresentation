## Dataset
The transformed connectivity consistent human body dataset can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Juyong/DHNN_BodyRepresentation).
## Requirements
### 1. Basic Environment
- Ubuntu,  CUDA-10.0, Python 3.7
- Python packages: PyTorch(1.3.0), PyTorch geometric(1.3.2), Numpy, openmesh, opencv, [batch_knn](https://github.com/jby1993/gpu_batch_knn)(some experiment codes need).
### 2. Install
- Make a folder called "models" in the repository directory.
- Download the [trained model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VMCK86OPVjO5wp1YpP13I8adWfQ061zG) and unzip to the "models" folder..
- Download the [trained extension model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FpHrKr9_2Hsno63Ox_T529bVa_tzcXh2) and unzip to the "models" folder.(Optional)
## Usage
The "exps" folder includes sample codes with test data of several experiments described in the paper.
- PoseTransferï¼šA sample code of pose transfer, running this code should produce the results of figure 13 in the paper.
- point2point: A sample code for registering meshes with same connectivity.
- DFaustFit: A sample code of the DFaust registration experiment.
- FaustAlign: A sample code of Faust alignment experiment.
- BodyFrom2DJoints: A sample code of 3D body pose estimation from 2D joints.
